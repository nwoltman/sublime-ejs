Thanks for installing EJS 2 :)

Here are some tips to help you get started with this package:


### Color Scheme

EJS 2 comes with the "Dracula EJS" color scheme which you can select from:
`Preferences` -> `Color Scheme` -> `EJS 2`.

Oceanic Next (https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) is also a
good color scheme for EJS that works right out of the box.


### Setting the default syntax

By default, files with the extension `.ejs` are opened with the `EJS (<% %>)` syntax.

If you'd like to open files with a different extension as EJS or you want to use delimiters
other than "<% %>", follow these steps to set the default EJS syntax for an extension:

1. Open an EJS file
2. Select `View` from the menu
3. Then `Syntax` -> `Open all with current extension as...` -> `EJS 2` -> `EJS (<delimiter>)`
4. Repeat this for each extension you want to open as EJS

This package includes syntax definitions for the following additional delimiters: `<? ?>`, `<$ $>`, `<@ @>`.


### Snippets

In the HTML scope:

+ `<%`+`TAB` - Inserts EJS open/close tags
+ `if`+`TAB` - Inserts EJS `if` statement
+ `for`+`TAB` - Inserts EJS `for` loop
